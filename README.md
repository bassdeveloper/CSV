# CSV

Objective : To implement a CSV (Comma Separated Values) Handler in C. The handler can parse through the files and generate an AVL tree based search, taking the attribute of the CSV file as a search paramaeter or key. Thus, Excel files can be handled, displayed and searched in the form of a text file in C. All that needs to be done is to save the .xls or .xlsx file as .csv and the handler can handle it. 

Scope : If implemented correctly, one can handle and write the whole data of a spreadsheet using just the program. It will also provide a fast method of searching the CSV file for some value.
